## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In my recent Frontend Mentor challenge, I successfully created a QR Code component using vanilla HTML5, CSS3, and custom properties, while leveraging Figma to analyze design files. This experience enriched my skills in front-end development and design comprehension. By implementing semantic HTML5, I ensured accessibility and SEO-friendliness.

Custom properties in CSS3 provided a flexible and maintainable codebase. Overcoming various challenges, like cross-browser compatibility and responsive design, honed my problem-solving abilities.

### Continued development

I am actively working on mastering the mobile-first responsive design approach, eager to apply it extensively in upcoming Frontend Mentor Challenges. My goal is to gain proficiency in utilizing diverse CSS properties, Semantic HTML, and other cutting-edge frontend technologies through hands-on practice.
